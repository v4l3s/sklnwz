Earlier this year the American School of Milan had the honor and pleasure to welcome Mrs. Liliana Segre as a special guest to talk and share her life experience with several of ASM’s students and parents. For both those who were or weren’t familiar with this woman and her life story, being able to attend her talk was undoubtedly a once in a lifetime enriching opportunity.


Mrs. Segre is known for being one of the fews that survived the atrocities of the nazis racial laws that ran across many countries, including Italy, in Europe during the Second World War and who is now able to speak about these events that occurred in her life to a vast variety of audiences. As one of the requests that Mrs. Segre had before starting her talk was not wanting any type of translation from Italian to English of what she was saying. Thus the majority of the people who attended had italian as their mother tongue or were fluent and knew the language really well.

As soon as she started speaking, Mrs. Segre was able to immediately hook the audience in such a way that everyone was able to pay attention for the entirety of the speech given the enormous admiration and interest that people felt towards her and her story.

  

She was only attending the third grade when her life took a major unexpected turn and Liliana Segre got expelled from her elementary school due to the fact that she belonged to a secular Jewish family. She only lived with her father and her grandparents, since her mother died when she was very young, hence she had a very good and strong relationship with her dad. From that day her father tried the impossible to protect him and his daughter from the occurring situation. First they tried to move away from Milan towards Northern Italy and then, after a failed attempt to escape to Switzerland the two got imprisoned in the San Vittore Jail in Milan. During her time there she got separated from her father and she explained how awful it felt to be far away from a paternal figure at a young age and her strong feelings of loneliness and nostalgia . After a while spent in San Vittore the two, with many others were put on a train that led to the concentration camp of Auschwitz and once they got there Mrs. Segre saw her dad for one last time before she was forced to go through intense jobs and duties in order to survive the German concentration camp for several years before getting freed by the American military.

During the talk it was impressive and eye-opening to see the way that Mrs. Segre was able to face her life’s challenges with such strength and resilience and managed not to give up in spite of the horrible situation that she had to live through. As she spoke to us she explained the way this experience reshaped the way she looked at life and encouraged us to view it through the same lens. There are numerous statements she made that could have struck each member of the audience differently and two of the messages she gave that held enormous importance was to never say that you can’t do something anymore and to remember to metaphorically always take steps forward and keep on going in that direction. These two abilities were probably what has given her the strength to survive the years she spent in Auschwitz without giving up. Listening to her talk was surely something useful for all of those attending as she said things that could have helped anyone who was facing challenges in their lives or it could just have been a way to learn more about her life and being able to hear a holocaust survivor speaking of how certain events helped her to approach life in a more positive way. Furthermore this experience taught her the importance of not giving up, even when big inconveniences happen, because life is an important gift and no matter how tough a situation might be it is always necessary to choose to live over anything and keep on going and she could share the relevance of this with the ASM community.

  

To conclude, being able to have such a powerful and resilient woman with such good morals speaking to the students was certainly a unique opportunity that was able to enrich and help all of us approach life in a certain manner.
