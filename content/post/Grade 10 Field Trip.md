This year, for the first time in quite some time, the tenth Grade class decided to not go on a field trip. They spent their field trip week here at ASM, where they attended their 4 core classes, participated in team building activities, and went on “mini” field trips around Milan and it’s surroundings. 

On Tuesday October 3rd, the Sophomores boarded a bus headed to Lake Como. After a longer than expected bus ride they finally arrived to the lake where they were greeted by its fresh air and colorful trees. They were asked to test their limits and step outside of their comfort zones. The students were challenged to swing from tree tops and most of them accepted the challenge with a smile on their faces. The high ropes course had different paths of varying difficulty. Students had the choice of undertaking a beginner, an intermediate, or an advanced course. Each more physically and mentally challenging than the previous. After completing their adventure, the sophomores enjoyed a quick outdoor lunch and then began their trip back to Milan.

Wednesday and Thursday were days characterized by the usual everyday activities. Tests were taken, notes were copied, and lessons were taught. Despite _____ most of the students say it wasn’t as bad as regular school days. The tenth grade shared an almost empty school with the seniors, and were very pleased by the fact they lunch line was significantly shorter and therefore faster. No one had complaints about how quiet the hallways were either. 

The Sophomores attended small workshops like, “You can't say that” or  storytelling and participated in group bonding activities in the gym, where they were encouraged to create new friendships while engaging in different games.

On Friday, students from the tenth grade who took spanish as a course were brought on a field trip to the center of Milan. They followed a tour guide from the Instituto Cervantes through the streets surrounding the Duomo and paid a visit to the Castello Sforzesco. As boring as this may sound, the tour was actually very interesting to the students as they learned the influence Spain had on the city of Milan and Italy as a whole. After learning a little bit about the history of the city, they headed for lunch at a Spanish delicatessen called, La Tienda de Juan. Here, the students ate “bocadillos”, or sandwiches in english. They were then able to meet with the owner of the restaurant, Juan, who was originally from Barcelona. The 10th graders were also allowed to prepare their own “tapas”, which is the name for a typical spanish appetizer. They presented the tapas they had created to their classmates informing them of what they had decided to put inside and naming them after a spanish city of their choice. Once they had finished eating their lunch, the Sophomores stopped at park to relax and take pictures, before catching the bus to return to ASM.

Even though the Sophomores did not get to go on an actual field trip, they did enjoy having the whole upper school to themselves and were sad about the week ending, knowing everyone was going come back on Monday. Hopefully, next year, the now eleventh graders will be able to participate in a field trip a little farther away from home, but nevertheless, they will always remember this unique experience.
