This year, grade 9 travelled to Sud Tyrol, which is a mountain range just outside the Austrian border with Italy. From a recent poll sent to the grade, 95% of students attended the trip and 55% of them would do it again. Overall, the students enjoyed the bonding time while hiking, the adventure/rope climbing parks, the mountain biking, and generally interacting with new people and making new friends.

In the American School of Milan, grades 4-11 have the opportunity to go on a class trip organized by the school for educational and bonding purposes. The trip occurs in the beginning of the year (usually October). This year, grade 9 travelled to Sud Tyrol, which is a mountain range just outside the Austrian border with Italy. From a recent poll sent to the grade, 95% of students attended the trip and 55% of them would do it again. Overall, the students enjoyed the bonding time while hiking, the adventure/rope climbing parks, the mountain biking, and generally interacting with new people and making new friends.

The trip mostly consisted in getting out of our comfort-zone, the class got to visit an Adventure Park, to challenge ourselves to complete physical tasks at different heights, and had some quality bonding time, as many were encouraging others and helping them when they were stuck on some course.

Another activity that was very much appreciated was the mountain biking around the woods. The class was divided into three major groups: beginners, medium, and advanced. Each group took different routes and went at different speeds, kids were being pushed to do their best and endure in the physical aspect, as most of the route was uphill, and it was quite challenging to keep up with the counsellor, especially for the advanced group. Long story short, everyone was quite sore after the activity.

An additional activity which forced the students to get out of their comfort zone was the hike. Students were asked to wake up at 4:00 am, delay their breakfast, and reach the peak of mountain, to look at the sunrise. When the sun showed up, students finally had the chance to have their meals, and later on they would proceed on a 20 km hike up in the mountains. They view was beautiful, and the students were happy to spend their last day surrounded by nature, and with their friends, although very tired.

The only downsides of the trip according to students were the lack of wifi and short time of free time to spend all together, but other than that the trip can be considered successful and most of the students that attended the trip would be happy to repeat it again.
