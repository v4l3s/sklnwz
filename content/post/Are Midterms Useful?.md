High Schoolers recently finished their exams week for which they had to prepare and learn the whole content learned throughout the first semester of school. In relations to the amount of stress and commitment that these midterms imply, the real question is whether having these exams in the middle of the year is actually beneficial for the students.

While talking to your classmates or studying with them for midterms it is possible to collect many opinions on what the majority of them thinks regarding these exams. The idea of making kids study and review all the past material from the beginning of the year has both negative and positive aspects to it. It is true that it could be a great way to make the students review all their material and maybe refresh their minds. Going back to reading past notes, summative tests or quizzes could be very useful in order to emphasize the understanding someone has on a specific topic. Furtherly with the great amount of work from every class that each student gets throughout one semester it is possible that many of the arguments covered at the very beginning of the year are often forgotten. Having midterms it’s a good excuse for someone to go back and go over what they do not remember anymore, it also gives students the opportunity to look back at things that they hadn’t understood completely and they can have a second chance of demonstrating their knowledge on that topic during the exam. It can be a great end of the semester for many people as reviewing old material a second time allows people to memorize something for a longer period of time and it also gives a chance to students who have a borderline grade to raise it to an higher grade.

On the other hand, speaking of changes in someone's final grade, if a student fails to prepare for midterms their grade could have a drastic drop which will then result in a decrease in their GPA, only because of one exams. This is where the cons regarding these midterms come into considerations. Majority of students find these end of the semester examinations really stressful, not necessarily because of their level of difficulty but because the idea of having to ‘re-learn’ so much content in a short period of time can be overwhelming. This can lead to students not performing up to their potential and them being very stressed the week prior to the exam. If the students end up doing worse in the midterms and their average won’t go up then all the stress and process for preparation ends up being unnecessary and not beneficial neither for the students themselves nor for their grade in the classes.

Despite many of their cons, midterms have many advantages regarding the learning of a student. Furtherly many schools around the globe make their high schoolers take exams at the end of each semester meaning that they can be beneficial and useful. It is the students’ responsibility to treasure the opportunity they have to bring their grades up and prepare themselves for their exams in order to bring up their grades and improve their understanding on all the several topics.
