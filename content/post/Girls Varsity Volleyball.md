They finished the first day with three wins and one loss, putting them in second place in their round. The second day started with a winning game vs TASIS, which placed them in the semi-finals where they lost vs Basel. Their last game was against ISZL. They won the first set with a score of 26-24, but lost the second and third set. The girls fought for each point , making everybody very proud.

On November 19th, the varsity team had the NISSA tournament in Lugano against 6 teams. They departed from ASM at 6:30 am and returned at around 5:30 pm. The result was definitely worth the loss of sleep. The girls won every set of every game, reaching the first position in the tournament. The final match was against Tasis, although very competitive, the girls were still able to win. It was a very successful season and hopefully next year’s season will be even better!
