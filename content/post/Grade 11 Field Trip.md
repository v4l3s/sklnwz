ASM’s grade 11 students were given the option to either participate in a trip to Berlin or in a trip to London. The one who chose London as their option has a great time visiting colleges all over London. This was an organised trip to tour and participate in workshops at some of the university in London. Over the five day trip, we attended Imperial College, University College London, SOAS, King’s College, Goldsmiths, London School of Economics and University of the Arts London.

ASM’s grade 11 students were given the option to either participate in a trip to Berlin or in a trip to London. The one who chose London as their option has a great time visiting colleges all over London. This was an organised trip to tour and participate in workshops at some of the university in London. Over the five day trip, we attended Imperial College, University College London, SOAS, King’s College, Goldsmiths, London School of Economics and University of the Arts London. Walking through the streets of London while learning about the academics and social life of the universities gave us a stronger idea of what university life was like. It made us start thinking about the accommodations, societies and location that we would prefer most and we therefore found this trip extremely useful.

We also visited Windsor castle, where we got a break for shopping and some historical knowledge about the monarchy of England. We even got to see a musical, the School of Rock, at a theatre. The trip was very fun and filled with new and useful experiences.
