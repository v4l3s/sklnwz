In this post, I'll be teaching you how to use StackEdit.

The basics are, at the top of the page you will put 
`+++` and you will write the title, date and maybe thumbnail image in this format.

    title= "[TITLE GOES HERE]"
    date= "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
    image= "http://imagelink.com"

Now the rest is really simple. Just use the normal tools like **bold**, *italics* and ~~strikethrough~~
in order to style this.

You can insert a quote with the quote button and it will look like this:

> A man is never too happy

Now that you have the post ready, you can sync it by going to the right side and clicking on the # image. Clicking **Sign in with Google** and signing in. Once you have that, click on **Synchronize>Save on Google Drive>Choose Folder** and go to your designated folder in the shared "School Publications". You should only have to select this once. When you do that and click on OK, your are done.
