In this post, I'll be teaching you how to use StackEdit.

The basics are, at the top of the page you will put 
`+++` and you will write the title, date and maybe thumbnail image in this format.

    title= "[TITLE GOES HERE]"
    date= "[YYYY-MM-DD]"
    image= "http://imagelink.com"

Once you have written your headline, you should type this in order to cut off the post and have a read more button:

    <!--more-->

Now the rest is really simple. Just use the normal tools like **bold**, *italics* and ~~strikethrough~~
in order to style this.

You can insert a quote with the quote button and it will look like this:

> A man is never too happy

Now that you have the post ready, you can sync it by going to the right side and clicking on the # image. Clicking **Sign in with Google** and signing in. Once you have that, click on **Synchronize>Save on Google Drive>Choose Folder** and go to your designated folder in the shared "School Publications". You should only have to select this once. When you do that and click on OK, your are done.

Here is an example of how this posts looks like in StackEdit format:
