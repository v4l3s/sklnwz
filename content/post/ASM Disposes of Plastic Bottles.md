The American school of Milan no longer sells plastic water bottles! They have been replaced with reusable metallic ones which have been supplied to every student. The disposable plastic cups used at the water fountains have also been removed. Instead, reusable plastic cups are available to be filled from one of the many water coolers. 
This admirable decision was made by the school management in order to reduce the amount of plastic that is thrown away, and therefore wasted, each day. 

If we consider that there are around 800 students in the school and that each student buys on average two bottles a day, we can see that each year we were creating an enormous amount of plastic! In fact, calculations show that it results in approximately 300 000 water bottles thrown away each year. 

All of this was done in the interest of an environmental responsibility. Drastically reducing the plastic consume at ASM will result in a big difference for the environment.  Just imagine what would happen if every school followed ASM’s lead. The environmental damage of consuming billions of bottles every year would be avoided. 

This change also had a great impact on students and teachers. Not only does it protect the environment, but also it saves everyone money and there is a lot less wasted water. The small metallic bottles are really sturdy, you can clip them to your bag so that you don’t lose them and they come in beautiful colours. Furthermore, There is also less litter so that the school is a much cleaner place. 

Everyone is really happy that the school thinks about making the world a cleaner: a better place for future generations!
