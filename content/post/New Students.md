Being a new student is always something extremely difficult to deal with. The same question keeps on popping up in each new student’s head, “Am I going to fit in?”. This year at the American School of Milan several students joined our community. ASM has a very multicultural community considering the fact that with only 700-800 students, 60% of them are international and among these, 50 different nationalities can be identified. This year, the new students that came to ASM were originally from places such as, Kazakhstan, Orlando, Miami, Indonesia, and San Carlo, as well as other international schools in Milan. Let’s hear from some of the these new students how they’re liking ASM so far.

Five students randomly selected from different grades were asked seven questions each. The first question was, “How is ASM different from your old school?”. Mora San Martin from the 11th grade said, “It’s all so different here: the people, the classes, the method for studying, and the amount of hours required for homework completion.” Marco Risi in grade 9 also said that the schedule and the classes are very different from what he had at his previous school. “At my old school, I had 7 periods a day that were around 45 minutes each. I had the same classes in the same order everyday, 1234567. Here instead, the schedule is different, we don't have the same classes every day. I like that because it’s easier to manage homework,” he said. Ilaria Pozzali from 9th grade said, “the system at ASM is totally different from my old school.” Beatrice, who is currently in 10th grade, said, “ASM is more professional and has a greater education than my old school. ASM is also more up to date and encourages many events that keep the students involved. It’s a better community as a whole. It is also different from my old school because it requires more work and more homework is given.” Kamila Sapiyeva from 9th grade said, “In my old school we had uniforms and a Cambridge Curriculum. At ASM we don’t have uniforms, which is something that I like and we follow an IB program, which I think is better.” Overall, it appears that the first impression ASM has given to our new students is better in comparison to what they thought about their old schools. 

The same students were then asked what they liked the most about ASM and what they think is something that they would change if they could. Kamila said she loves the food because it’s fresh, it’s italian and it’s  made on a daily basis in the kitchen. She also likes the fact that students are able to choose electives, because it gives them an opportunity to take the classes they are actually interested in. Beatrice said, “I like the events that the school organizes and the method the teachers use for teaching. I also really enjoy the involvement there is with the community.” Ilaria has told us that she hasn’t been here long enough to tell know what she would want to change, however she did say that so far she found herself liking the schedule, the food and the people. Marco says he enjoys the working environment that is created and the way the classes are arranged however he would want to change the grading system. I’m sure most of you are aware of this but for those of you who still didn’t quite understand, a summative is usually a test that is now worth most of your grade while formatives are quizzes or assignments that depending on the course are worth either 0 of 10% of the final grade. Last year this was different because summatives were worth 80% and formatives were 20% and this was the same for all classes. This gave students an opportunity to make up for a low grade with the help of formatives which are usually easier than the summatives. Although Marco wasn’t hear last year, he said that, from what he head, it would be better to establish the system that was used last year. Mora says, “I like that you can choose electives. I like the people and I love the events the school organizes, like the Halloween party, the picnics and the field trips. I don’t think I would change anything even if I could, ASM is great just the way it is.” 

The fourth question asked was, “How hard or easy was it to make friends?” Four out of the five students interviewed said that it was easy for them to make new friends after they moved to ASM. Some of the things they said were, “As soon as I arrived, everyone immediately approached me.” and, “It was pretty easy to make friendships because the people here are really nice and friendly.” 

The next question was, “Do you feel about ASM’s environment?” Once again, four out of five students answered that ASM has a friendly and welcoming environment. One of them said, “Overall the environment is pretty tolerant because all of the new students are welcomed with open arms.” The only negative comment that was made was, “The teachers are really helpful and nice, however, I believe that some of the people in my grade are not  that amicable. Sometimes it’s hard to get along with them, but of course that is not everyone.” 

The sixth question asked was, “Do you think ASM has a good learning environment?” All of the students answered yes to this question. The most reasoned comment was, “Yes because all of the teachers are energetic and the students can clearly see that they want to and enjoy teaching.”

The final question was, “In what ways do you think ASM is similar to your old school?”. Marco Risi said that ASM and his old school have similar rules and most of the subjects taught are the same. Mora said, “In my old school we were also able to choose our classes however, there weren’t as many choices as there are hear at ASM. Also the people in both schools were very friendly.” Ilaria said, “It is similar to my old school because both of them are relatively small schools that don't have an huge number of students, which is good.” Kamila stated that both ASM and her old school had a variety of different nationalities and for this reason she has been able to connected to different cultures in both schools. 

Overall from what we heard, we can say that these five new students are enjoying their time at ASM so far and do believe that ASM has a great loving community with a good learning environment. Being a new student myself too, last year, I would like to agree with these responses. ASM and its people immediately accepted me when I arrived and coming to this school was a major step up compared to my old school. If by any chance you are reading this and you are not currently a student at ASM, what are you still waiting for? Come on, get on over here! This is one of the best school you will ever have the pleasure to attend. With a welcoming environment and friendly faces, you will never feel lost or alone.
