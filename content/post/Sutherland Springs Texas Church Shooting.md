It’s a story of great courage, of community. It reminds us of the world we live in and the reality of how sometimes awful things can happen to the most innocent of people. Often times this reality is hard for us to accept and makes us want to ignore the truth.

A gunman identified as Devin Patrick Kelley opened fire on a group of unsuspecting Churchgoers at First Baptist Church Sunday morning around 11:27 a.m. fatally killing 26 and wounding an additional 20 more. Among the deceased were the pastor's 14-year-old daughter and an unborn fetus, with victims ranging in age from 1 to 77.

Before this week Sutherland Springs, 40 miles southeast of San Antonio, was a rural farming town in south Texas with a meer population of 600. Here, in the unlikeliest of places, the 5th deadliest mass shooting in US history occurred, shocking and saddening the entire world. A local shop owner, Dana Fletcher, described the town as “very small” but a “tight-knit community”. 

This incident came as a shock to US citizens as it took place just weeks after the Las Vegas attack, and it seemed the nation was only just now recovering. The sudden increase in random acts of violence is emphasized by the fact that two of the deadliest mass shootings in US history have taken place in the past 35 days. These unprecedented crimes are often the hardest to comprehend, especially as authorities in Texas have not been able to find a solid motive in what motivated Kelley to commit such horrendous acts. 

Kelley’s troubled past is now emerging including a dishonorable discharge from the Air Force, domestic violence, alleged sexual assault,  animal cruelty, threatening text messages, escapes from mental institutions and an uncanny obsession with guns and mass shootings. President Trump described it as a mental health problem at the highest level and authorities are questioning how psychiatrists could not have seen it coming with many so-called “warning signs”. 

This incident brings the never-ending discussion of strengthening gun laws to the public's attention with Sutherland Springs being critics greatest supporter. Many continue to ask what will change, or how our governments will respond to such circumstances. While these are difficult questions to answer it has been discovered that Kelley should not have legally been able to buy firearms under Texas law. With such a violent past as his, this puts a spotlight on Texas gun laws and their effectiveness. 

The Air Force is also claiming responsibility for the mishap as their convictions did not properly transfer to local law enforcement records which would have allowed for such information to show on a background check. Nevertheless, Kelley was allowed to casually buy the gun he used Sunday, in 2016 at a sporting goods store in San Antonio. 
Although this is a story of great despair it also highlights the American resolve of two Texas natives with aims of protecting the dignity and safety of their hometown. Stephen Williford was hailed a good Samaritan when he ran barefoot out of his house to stop the shooter. With his own handgun, Williford shot and injured Kelley, who then proceeded to flee the scene in his truck. Along with Johnnie Langendorff, a bystander to the scene, they followed the shooter in a high-speed chase until Kelley’s car lost control and slid off the roadway. Devin Kelley was later pronounced dead upon the authorities arrival at the scene.  

But how does this affect us here at ASM? It’s a story of great courage, of community. It reminds us of the world we live in and the reality of how sometimes awful things can happen to the most innocent of people. Often times this reality is hard for us to accept and makes us want to ignore the truth. While this topic is one that is understandably complex, it can be agreed that there is no simple answer. So instead we should focus on the bravery and kindness of  Stephen Williford and Johnnie Langendorff and use these two good citizens as models to show the use and importance of community. A pillar on which our own school stands on and obviously places great value on it as we continue to strive for unfailing bonds to be made within our own school walls.
